# Roadtrip

This algorithm reads the a textfile that the user inputs (in this case station.txt) and does the following:

1. Displays the locations from the shortest distance from the starting point, to the longest distance. 
2. Shows miles per tank 
3. Calculates the total number of pit stops needed to complete the roadtrip 
4. Lists the location of the pit stop with the distance
